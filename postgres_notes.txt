@Data Base 

--> Postgres 

Psycopg  --> Python Package to Connect to PostGres DB
Cx_Oracle --> Python Package to Connect to Oracle DB

Always use placeholder in the SQL query, since - Postgres will validate input for sql injection

we don't directly interact with database directly 
we will use a software refers as Database Management System(DBMS)
we will use SQL to communicate with DBMS 
Each instance of the Postgres can be carved into multiple separate DataBases
Postgres always comes with a default db: postgres to interact 

SQL( Relational) Vs NoSQL

RealDictCursor -> it will return SQL result with Column Header 

from psycopg2.extra import RealDictCursor 

Cursor -> connection 
psycopg2.connect(host='localhost', database='fastapi', user=admin, password='password', cursor_factory= RealDictCursor)
Cursor.execute()
Cursor.fetchone()
cursor.fetchmany()
cursor.fetchall()
cursor.commit()
